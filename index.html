                <br> - Artist Introduction -<br>
                <br> <br>
                The current themes are mostly about uncertainty and fear of the unknown in relation <br>
                to one's surroundings and future situation. I believe that creation is also a process of healing, <br>
                 and that there is a hidden ugliness, dirtiness and mystery in the fables,  <br>
                 trying to discover the detached, unpleasant part of the language that exists in the vision. <br>
                 <br>
               
                In the future, I would like to continue to focus on how the emotions and aesthetics of rationality,  <br>
                restraint and pinnacle are integrated into the story through the brushstroke. <br>
                 The focus is on using this contradictory personal feeling as an undercurrent for the creation <br>
                  of a small number of human beings and events.  <br>
                  Some of these events are sudden and some have always been present in human life, <br>
                   yet forgotten and ignored. At the same time, it is also expected that more different  <br>
                   ways of presentation will emerge in conjunction with other fields of art, <br>
                    hoping that the hand of artistic practice will bring difficult and obscure <br>
                     theories closer to life, rather than keep them on the shelf, <br>
                      and perhaps bring an answer to many who are confused. 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                
                By creating works through multiple-media, I hope to combine traditional art creation <br>
                 tools with creative programming in the future. <br>
